# Project Title

One already has too much to attend to, stop bothering yourself, this tool would allow you to attend to what is important - code.

A CLI tool that would give control to the user see only terminal output information user interested in, it redirects miscellaneous terminal output information, logs it into the journalling system, on the return value would output the whole log at once, and offer the flexibility of the behavior. So people can wrap the commands into it, form aliases and receive only info they considered important.


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

2020-09-05: NOTE: Currely Zen expects `systemd` init system. In Haskell there is no module to detect runtime system (*sic), so prejudjment is put in OS/init-detection, the resting code is in `OS.hs`.

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
